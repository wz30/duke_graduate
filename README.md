The repo includes duke course materials and my peronsal suugestions, and track what I learned and achieved since joined Duke. 

## Duke Courses

### Fall Semster 2020
- machine leaning in CS department
- computer security in ECE
- Introduction to AI in CS
- Algorithms in real world undergrad courses in CS
- SLIM - network research

#### Intro to AI
- final exam: Since COVID 19, it is a 3 hout exam. And the problem is quite comprehensive, including all the core parts taught in class. 
  - submodular
  - HMM: computer viterbi, forward, backward.
  - Baynes Net: 
    - best case and worst case to compute p(XiXj) in terms of time complexity. 
    - reduce 3SAT to problem "in baysian network, at most two parents, is p(x)>0"
  - Linear sperable: given specific linear funtion such as w1x1+w2x2+w3x3 + w4 >0 , check if given formula is linear seperable or not. E.g. X1 or (X2 and X3)
  - Using Baynes net as linear classfier and derive the expression to compute the label
  - ML: understand what trend of plot when the factors change?
    - learning rate is too high/low
    - iteration is not enough
    - training set is too small
    - stuck on local optimal

### Winter break(two months or more)
- Since school ends Fall early, we have two months winter break ever. It is the longest one ever.
- I had an ambitious and detailed plan but it did not work very well.
  - keep working on the research every week but not really productive since I was stuck on this and did not yield any good outputs. Vicious cycle begins. BTW, the research topic is about container and networking. it is a good and a promising area. However, I did not have enough knowledge on that. 
  - OSTEP book: three easy pieces book. Finished around 20 or less chapters. It is a great book to learn and start operating system.
  - first couple chapters of Linux programming intereface.
  - leetcode problem , not a lot.
  - ski once and that was a good experience 
  - container and k8s learning. 
  - Teaching Charles and Cindy every week.
- Overall, it is not a productive winter break and did not work a lot every day. Thera are couple improvements. 
  - workout and shower are the best and feasible way to recover from "Pandenmic mood"
