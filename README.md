The repo includes duke course materials and my peronsal suugestions, and track what I learned and achieved since joined Duke. 

## Duke Courses

### Fall Semster 2020
- machine leaning in CS department
- computer security in ECE
- Introduction to AI in CS
- Algorithms in real world undergrad courses in CS
- SLIM - network research

#### Intro to AI
- final exam: Since COVID 19, it is a 3 hout exam. And the problem is quite comprehensive, including all the core parts taught in class. 
  - submodular
  - HMM: computer viterbi, forward, backward.
  - Baynes Net: 
    - best case and worst case to compute p(XiXj) in terms of time complexity. 
    - reduce 3SAT to problem "in baysian network, at most two parents, is p(x)>0"
  - Linear sperable: given specific linear funtion such as w1x1+w2x2+w3x3 + w4 >0 , check if given formula is linear seperable or not. E.g. X1 or (X2 and X3)
  - Using Baynes net as linear classfier and derive the expression to compute the label
  - ML: understand what trend of plot when the factors change?
    - learning rate is too high/low
    - iteration is not enough
    - training set is too small
    - stuck on local optimal
